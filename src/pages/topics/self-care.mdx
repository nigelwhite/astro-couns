### What do you put into your body?

Eat food. Not too much. Mainly plants.
Ultra-processed products contain all sorts of things, some of which aren't even food. When we are used to flavour-enhanced producuts ordinary vegetables can seem bland. To give your taste buds the best chance of adapting, try cutting out processed products alltogether and stick to that for a few weeks - see if you feel different. The preparation will take you longer, but cooking isn't a bad way to spend your time. If you live near a proper vegetable shop it will be cheaper.

### What do you put into your mind?

Imagine you allowed just anything to come into your home..... Imagine the state your home would be in after months or years..... Instead of allowing anything, you discriminate wisely and keep out stuff that offends you. Try doing the same with what you put in your mind. Take in media that you judge to be painting a good picture of what it is to be a human being. If we are used to high-impact, edgy material then something kinder will seem bland, but give it some time and see if you feel different.
